        <h2>Founded in Bowling Green, Kentucky </h2>
        <p>Cage The Elephant consists of brothers Matt(vocals) and Brad(Guitar) Schultz, Daniel Tichenor(Bassist), and Jared Champion(drums). The Schultz brothers come from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/cage-the-elephant-on-escaping-kentucky-sibling-rivalry-trippy-new-lp-35927/" >humble beginnings and a rough upbringing.</a> They lived in a trailer park with their grandmother after their parents divorce. Matt would get bullied in school for being poor. Before the band went on tour, Matt was working as a plumber.</p>
        <p>The band was first signed on to Relentless Records which was based in the UK (an unexpected offer). In the summer of '08, CTE finally broke through with their hit single "Aint No Rest For The Wicked". In 2008 their self titled debut album was welcomed with high praise and it's been smooth sailing since. CTE can be categorized as alternative rock with elements from garage rock, indie rock, pop rock, post-punk rock.</p>
